        question: "What is the Virtual DOM?",
        type: 'subjective',
        answer: "The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where a virtual representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the 'real' DOM by a library like React. This abstraction allows the library to batch DOM updates and optimize rendering by comparing the VDOM with a snapshot taken before an update, and only applying the differences to the actual DOM.",

        question: "What is the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?",
        type: 'subjective',
        answer: "The `==` operator performs type coercion before comparison (loose equality), meaning it will try to convert the operands to a common type before checking for equality. The `===` operator (strict equality) checks for both value and type equality without coercion. For example, `5 == '5'` is true, but `5 === '5'` is false.",
        explanation: "It is generally recommended to use `===` to avoid unexpected bugs from type coercion."
    },

        question: "What is a 'closure' in JavaScript?",
        type: 'subjective',
        answer: "A closure is a function that has access to its outer function's scope (lexical environment) even after the outer function has returned. It 'closes over' the variables from its lexical scope, allowing it to remember and access those variables. This allows for powerful patterns like data privacy and function factories.",
        explanation: "Closures are a fundamental concept in JavaScript."
    },
    {
        id: 28,
        testId: 3,

        question: "What does the `position: relative;` property do in CSS?",
        type: 'subjective',
        answer: "It positions an element relative to its normal position in the document flow. You can then use `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties to offset it from this normal position without affecting the layout of surrounding elements. It also creates a new stacking context and acts as the containing block for any absolutely positioned child elements.",
        explanation: "It's a key property for controlling layout and is often used as a container for absolutely positioned elements."
    },
    {
        id: 29,

        question: "What is event bubbling in the DOM?",
        type: 'subjective',
        answer: "Event bubbling is a type of event propagation where an event first triggers on the innermost target element, and then successively on its ancestors (parents) in the DOM tree until it reaches the document's root object. This is the default behavior for most DOM events.",
        explanation: "Understanding event propagation (bubbling and its opposite, capturing) is key for handling complex user interactions and for techniques like event delegation."
    },
    {
        id: 30,
        testId: 3,
        difficulty: 'medium',
        question: "What is the purpose of the `Promise.all()` method?",
        type: 'subjective',
        answer: "`Promise.all()` takes an iterable of promises and returns a single Promise that resolves when all of the promises in the iterable have resolved. The resolved value is an array of the results. If any of the promises reject, the returned promise immediately rejects with the reason of the first promise that rejected.",
        explanation: "It's useful for aggregating the results of multiple asynchronous operations."

        question: "Explain the concept of 'hoisting' in JavaScript.",
        type: 'subjective',
        answer: "Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of the current scope before code execution. `var` declarations are hoisted and initialized with `undefined`. `let` and `const` are hoisted but not initialized, which creates a 'Temporal Dead Zone' where they cannot be accessed before their declaration.",
        explanation: "This is why you can call a function declared with `function` before its definition, but not a function assigned to a `let` variable."

        type: 'subjective',
        answer: "`undefined` typically means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. It's the default value of uninitialized variables. `null` is an assignment value that can be assigned to a variable to represent the intentional absence of any object value.",
        explanation: "`typeof undefined` is 'undefined', while `typeof null` is 'object', which is a historical bug."

        question: "How does CSS Grid Layout differ from Flexbox?",
        type: 'subjective',
        answer: "The primary difference is that Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts (a row OR a column). CSS Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts (rows AND columns at the same time). Grid provides more control over the overall page layout, while Flexbox excels at aligning content within a container.",
        explanation: "Grid is for layout of the page, Flexbox is for layout of components."

        question: "Explain the `async` and `await` keywords in JavaScript.",
        type: 'subjective',
        answer: "`async` functions are a special syntax for working with promises. An `async` function always returns a promise. The `await` keyword can only be used inside an `async` function and it pauses the function's execution, waiting for a promise to resolve or reject. This makes asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code, improving readability.",

        answer: "XSS is a security vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can be used to steal session tokens, deface websites, or redirect users. React helps prevent XSS by automatically escaping JSX content before rendering it, converting strings to plain text.",

        type: 'subjective',
        answer: "A controlled component is a form element (like `<input>`) whose value is controlled by React state. The state is the single source of truth. An uncontrolled component is a form element whose value is handled by the DOM itself. You typically use a `ref` to get its value when needed.",

To allow them, the server at the requested origin must include specific CORS headers (like `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`) in its response.",

The ancestor component then owns the 'single source of truth' and passes the state and state-updating functions down to the children via props. This is used when several components need to reflect the same changing data.",

        question: "Describe the JavaScript event loop.",
        type: 'subjective',
        answer: "The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript's single thread to handle asynchronous operations. It consists of a call stack, a message queue (or callback queue), and Web APIs. When an async operation completes (e.g., a `setTimeout`), its callback is placed in the queue. The event loop continuously checks if the call stack is empty. If it is, it takes the first message from the queue and pushes its callback onto the stack to be executed.",

        question: "How would you debounce a function in JavaScript?",
        type: 'subjective',
        answer: "Debouncing is a technique to limit the rate at which a function gets called. You would create a wrapper function that uses `setTimeout`. Inside the wrapper, you first clear any existing timeout with `clearTimeout`, then set a new timeout to execute the original function after a specified delay. This ensures the function only runs once after a burst of calls has ended.",

        type: 'subjective',
        answer: "The value of `this` is determined by how a function is called (its execution context). In a method (e.g., `obj.myMethod()`), `this` refers to the owner object. In a regular function, `this` refers to the global object (`window` in browsers) or `undefined` in strict mode. In an event handler, `this` refers to the element that received the event. Arrow functions do not have their own `this`; they lexically bind it from their parent scope.",

They are set using custom property notation (e.g., `--main-color: #ff0000;`) and are accessed using the `var()` function. Benefits include DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code, easier theming, and the ability to be read and changed dynamically via JavaScript.",

        type: 'subjective',
        answer: "Hydration is the process of attaching event listeners and making the static HTML received from a server-side rendering (SSR) process interactive. React 'hydrates' the server-rendered HTML by building its virtual DOM in memory, comparing it to the existing HTML, and then attaching the necessary JavaScript logic and event listeners to the markup.",

        type: 'subjective',
        answer: 'Event delegation is a technique where you add a single event listener to a parent element to manage events for all of its children, including dynamically added ones. When an event bubbles up from a child, the parent listener can check the `event.target` property to identify which child triggered the event and respond accordingly. This improves performance by reducing the number of event listeners.',

        type: 'subjective',
        answer: "Reconciliation is the process through which React updates the DOM. When a component's state or props change, React creates a new virtual DOM tree. It then compares ('diffs') this new tree with the previous one using a heuristic algorithm. Based on this comparison, it computes the most efficient, minimal set of changes needed to update the real DOM and applies them in a batch.",

A component with a render prop (e.g., `<DataProvider render={data => <h1>{data.name}</h1>} />`) calls this function to delegate its rendering logic, enabling powerful and flexible composition.",

        type: 'subjective',

Debouncing ensures that a function is only called after a certain period of inactivity (e.g., after the user stops typing for 300ms). Throttling is about limiting the rate, while debouncing is about waiting for a pause.",

        answer: "`<div>` is a block-level element, `<span>` is an inline element",
        explanation: "A `div` takes up the full width available, while a `span` only takes up as much width as necessary."

            "`const` is function-scoped, `let` and `var` are block-scoped",
            "There is no difference in scope"
        ],
        answer: "`var` is function-scoped, `let` and `const` are block-scoped",
        explanation: "This is a key difference. `let` and `const` offer more predictable scoping within loops and conditional blocks."

        question: "What is `Promise.allSettled()`?",
        type: 'mcq',
        options: [
            "It returns a promise that resolves when all promises have resolved",
            "It returns a promise that resolves after all of the given promises have either fulfilled or rejected",

            "It rejects if any of the promises reject"
        ],
        answer: "It returns a promise that resolves after all of the given promises have either fulfilled or rejected",
        explanation: "Unlike `Promise.all()`, it never rejects. It's useful when you need to know the outcome of every promise, regardless of success."

        question: "What is a `Symbol` in JavaScript?",
        type: 'subjective',
        answer: "A `Symbol` is a unique and immutable primitive data type introduced in ES6. Symbols are often used as keys for object properties to avoid name collisions, as each symbol value returned from `Symbol()` is guaranteed to be unique.",
        explanation: "This is useful for defining 'private' or internal properties on objects."

        question: 'What is "code splitting"?',
        type: 'subjective',
        answer: "Code splitting is a feature supported by bundlers like Webpack or Rollup which can create multiple bundles that can be dynamically loaded at runtime. Instead of one massive bundle, you can split code by route or component. This is crucial for improving initial page load time, as the user only downloads the code needed for the initial view.",
        explanation: "`React.lazy` and dynamic `import()` are common ways to implement code splitting."

        question: "What are ES modules (ESM)?",
        type: 'subjective',
        answer: 'ES Modules are the official, standardized module system for JavaScript, introduced in ES6. They use the `import` and `export` statements. Unlike older systems like CommonJS, ESM is resolved statically at parse time, which allows for powerful optimizations like tree shaking. They are the standard for modern browsers and Node.js.',
        explanation: "They offer a cleaner syntax and better performance than older module systems."

        question: "What is OAuth 2.0?",
        type: 'subjective',
        answer: "OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework, not an authentication protocol. It enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to a user's account on an HTTP service. It works by delegating user authentication to the service that hosts the user account and authorizing the third-party application to access the user account via access tokens, rather than sharing the user's credentials.",
        explanation: "It's the industry standard for authorization, used by Google, Facebook, and others."

        question: "What is a `WeakMap` in JavaScript?",
        type: 'subjective',
        answer: "A `WeakMap` only accepts objects as keys and holds 'weak' references, meaning if there are no other references to an object used as a key, it can be garbage collected. This is its main difference from a regular `Map`, which holds strong references. `WeakMap` is not iterable and is primarily used to prevent memory leaks by associating data with an object without preventing its collection.",
        explanation: "It's an advanced feature for specific memory management scenarios."

        question: "What is the purpose of `Array.prototype.flat()`?",
        type: 'subjective',
        answer: "The `flat()` method creates a new array with all sub-array elements concatenated into it recursively up to a specified depth. The default depth is 1. This is useful for simplifying nested arrays into a single, flat array.",
        explanation: "For example, `[1, [2, 3], [4, [5]]].flat()` results in `[1, 2, 3, 4, [5]]`."

        question: "What is the `will-change` CSS property used for?",
        type: 'subjective',
        answer: "The `will-change` property provides a hint to the browser about what properties of an element are expected to change in the future. This allows the browser to set up optimizations in advance, before the element is actually changed. For example, it might move the element to its own layer on the GPU. It should be used sparingly as it can be a performance cost if overused.",
        explanation: "It's a way to tell the browser 'get ready to animate this'."

        question: "What is `ESLint` and why is it useful?",
        type: 'subjective',
        answer: "`ESLint` is a static analysis tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript code. It's highly configurable and helps enforce code quality, style consistency, and prevent common errors. By analyzing code without executing it, it can catch bugs early in the development process.",
        explanation: "It's an essential tool for any modern JavaScript project, especially for teams."

        question: "What is `git cherry-pick` used for?",
        type: 'subjective',
        answer: "`git cherry-pick` is a command used to apply a specific commit from one branch onto another branch. Instead of merging an entire branch, it allows you to select individual commits. This is useful for backporting a bug fix or applying a small feature from a development branch to a stable branch.",
        explanation: "It's a powerful tool for surgical changes between branches."

        question: "What is the difference between `Promise.all()` and `Promise.allSettled()`?",
        type: 'subjective',
        answer: "`Promise.all()` takes an iterable of promises and returns a single promise that resolves with an array of all resolved values. It is 'fail-fast', meaning it will reject immediately if any of the input promises reject. `Promise.allSettled()` also takes an iterable, but it waits for all promises to settle (either fulfill or reject) and returns a promise that resolves with an array of objects, each describing the outcome of a promise.",
        explanation: "Use `all()` when you need all promises to succeed. Use `allSettled()` when you need to know the outcome of every promise, regardless of success."
