    { id: 52, testId: 6, difficulty: 'hard', question: "Explain how `this` keyword works in JavaScript.", type: 'subjective', answer: "The value of `this` depends on the context in which it is called. In a method, it refers to the owner object. In a regular function, it refers to the global object (or `undefined` in strict mode). In an event, it refers to the element that received the event. Arrow functions lexically bind `this` from their parent scope." },

    { id: 55, testId: 6, difficulty: 'hard', question: "What is the difference between a `Map` and a `WeakMap` in JavaScript?", type: 'subjective', answer: "A `WeakMap` only accepts objects as keys. The references to the keys are held 'weakly', meaning if there are no other references to an object used as a key, it can be garbage collected. A `Map` can have any value (primitive or object) as a key and holds strong references, preventing garbage collection." },
    { id: 57, testId: 6, difficulty: 'hard', question: "Explain event delegation.", type: 'subjective', answer: 'Event delegation is a technique involving adding a single event listener to a parent element to manage events for all of its children. When an event bubbles up from a child, the parent can check the event target and decide what to do. It improves performance by reducing the number of event listeners.'},
    { id: 58, testId: 6, difficulty: 'medium', question: "What is the purpose of the `key` prop in React lists?", type: 'subjective', answer: "Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be stable, predictable, and unique to give the elements a stable identity, which helps React optimize rendering by reordering or reusing elements instead of re-creating them." },
    { id: 59, testId: 6, difficulty: 'medium', question: "What is a pure function?", type: 'subjective', answer: 'A pure function is a function that, given the same input, will always return the same output and has no side effects.

    { id: 76, testId: 7, difficulty: 'hard', question: "How does React's reconciliation algorithm work?", type: 'subjective', answer: "Reconciliation is the process through which React updates the DOM. When a component's state changes, React creates a new virtual DOM tree and compares it ('diffing') with the previous one.
